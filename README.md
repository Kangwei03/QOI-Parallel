This study explores the optimization of the encoding and decoding process of the Quite OK Image (QOI) format through parallel computing. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of three different parallelization methods (CUDA for GPU acceleration, OpenMP for multi-core CPU utilization, and OpenMPI for distributed computing) when applied to a practical lossless image compression task. Our approach focuses on precise performance measurements using get_time_ns() and excludes peripheral operations such as disk I/O, CUDA initialization, and MPI environment setup to ensure accurate comparative analysis. By implementing and analyzing these parallel computing strategies, we seek to identify the best approach for different image processing scenarios and provide insights into scalable solutions for network-based image transmission applications. The relative advantages of each parallelization technique under different operating conditions are demonstrated through comprehensive benchmark data and visually documented performance results.
